## UX

The strategy was to create an **easy-to-navigate, visually engaging gym website**. It should:  

- Attract new members with clear membership plans.  
- Showcase available gym equipment to inspire confidence and know what they expect .  
- Provide practical info (location, opening hours, contact details).  
- Allow users to submit forms with their membership plans. 

### Colour Scheme

- `#0b089e` – Primary background (hero + membership section)  
- `#ffffff` – Main text + background for cards  
- `#000000` – Logo and key typography  
- Accent: Red (`#ff0000`) for **X** in logo 

## User Stories

### New Users  
- As a visitor, I want to quickly see membership options, so I can choose a plan.  
- As a visitor, I want to explore the equipment available, so I know what’s in the gym.  
- As a visitor, I want to find contact details and opening hours, so I can visit.  

### Returning Users  
- As a member, I want to confirm gym opening times.  
- As a member, I want to revisit equipment information to guide my workouts.  
- As a member, I want to stay updated about the gyms history on social media

- Custom error page with navigation back to site. 


- ### Title & Hero Image
  - The title for the homepage floats above the hero image and scrolls with the page. The image used is a classic boardgame which is eyecatching and instantly recognisable. When the upcoming page is being viewed on tablet size and above, the title remains in place while the content scrolls next to it.

    ![Homepage title and hero image](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-title-hero.png "Homepage title and hero") ![Upcoming title with scrolling content](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-title.png "Upcoming title and scrolling content")    

- ### Navigation Bar
  - The navigation bar appears differently depending on whether the user is on a hand held mobile device such as phones and tablets, or using larger devices such as Laptops and Desktops.
  - Hand held devices have the navigation bar at the bottom with a burger menu to access the links. This is for easier one handed accessibility. 
  
    ![Mobile nar bar](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-mobile-nav.png "Mobile nav bar")
  
  - Larger devices have the navigation bar at the top of the page and the links are expanded so in view all the time.

    ![Larger nav bar](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-larger-nav.png "Larger device nav bar")

- ### Club details section
  - This section tells the user the important information about the club including links to the appropriate sections of the site for more details on location, upcoming events and how to sign up to the newsletter.

    ![Info section](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-what-who-where.png "Information section")

- ### Map integration
  - The embedded Google map shows the location of where the club meets. This is for potential new members so they can see exactly where to find the club.
  - The link to open the larger map opens in a separate tab.

    ![Map section](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-map.png "Google map for location")

- ### Footer
  - The footer has the links to the clubs social media. This encourages the user to conmect via social media.
  - Links open in a separate tab.

    ![Social media footer](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-socials.png "Social media links")

- ### Upcoming Events page
  - This section of the site gives both current members and potential new members all the info they need on what's happening in upcoming meets.
  - This gives them the ability to plan whether they want to attend certain dates or not.

    ![Upcoming events](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-page.png "Upcoming page")

- ### Newsletter page
  - This page gives the user the option to sign up to an email newsletter that would send out info about the club.
  - This might include highlights of the last meet, details on the next few meets and any other interesting news.

    ![Newsletter page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-newsletter-page.png "Newsletter page")

- ### Newsletter confirmation page
  - This page confirms that the form submission has been successful and that they are signed up to receive the newsletter.

    ![Newsletter confirmation page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-confirmation.png "Newsletter confirmation page")

- ### 404 Error page
  - This page shows up when there has been a 404 error. It gives the user options to navigate to other pages of the site.

    ![404 page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-404.png "404 page")

### Future Features

  - I would like to add a feature on the pages that the floating title scrolls. When the title scrolls out of view I'd like to change it to a static bar at the top similar to the navbar when it is at the top.
  - A forum page would also be good for members as they can discuss future meets, ideas about the club and connect.
  - It would be good for the data in the newsletter submission to actually be sent to the author of the website so that a newsletter can be sent.
